## Contribution Agreement & Licensing

### The Public License
This project is licensed under the **GNU General Public License v3 (GPLv3)**. This ensures that the community version of Traffic Light remains free and open-source software.

### Copyright Grant and Waiver
By submitting a contribution (including but not limited to code, documentation, or assets) to this project, you agree to the following:

1. **Grant of Rights:** You grant **leekleak** (the Project Owner) a non-exclusive, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable, and transferable license to use, modify, distribute, and sublicense your contribution.
2. **Dual-Licensing Permission:** You acknowledge and agree that the Project Owner may include your contribution in:
   - The open-source version of the project (under GPLv3).
   - Any **closed-source, proprietary, or commercial versions** of the project (e.g., a "Pro" or "Enterprise" fork).
3. **Ownership:** You retain the copyright to your original work, but you grant the Project Owner the equivalent rights to use and re-license that work as if they were a co-owner.
   
**Why do we require this?**
To ensure the long-term sustainability of Traffic Light, the Project Owner maintains the ability to distribute the application across various platforms (like the Google Play Store) that may require proprietary integrations, specific hardware compliance,
or terms that conflict with the strict requirements of the GPLv3. This dual-licensing approach allows the project to remain free and open-source for the community while remaining viable in restrictive ecosystems.
