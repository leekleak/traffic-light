Last Updated: January 18, 2026

Developer: leekleak (GitHub: leekleak/traffic-light)

At Traffic Light, we believe that your data belongs to you. This Privacy Policy explains how our application handles information. The short version: We do not collect, store, or transmit your personal data.
1. Information Collection and Use

Traffic Light is designed to be a local-only utility.

No Personal Data: The app does not require or collect personal identifiers such as your name, email address, phone number, or location.

Usage Data: While the app monitors your network speed and data usage to provide its core functionality, this data is processed locally on your device and is never uploaded to any external servers.

2. Data Storage

All data displayed in the app is stored locally.

3. Third-Party Services

Traffic Light is an open-source project and does not include third-party SDKs for analytics, advertising, or tracking (e.g., no Firebase Analytics, no AdMob).

4. Security

We prioritize the security of your device. By keeping the app open-source, the community can audit our code at any time to ensure no hidden tracking or malicious behavior exists.

5. Changes to This Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Since the app does not communicate with a server, we recommend checking the GitHub repository for any updates to this document.

6. Contact Us

If you have any questions or suggestions about this Privacy Policy, please feel free to open an issue on our GitHub repository.
