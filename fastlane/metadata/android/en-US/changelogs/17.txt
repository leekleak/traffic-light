Widgets (Experimental):
- Added basic widget support for configured data plans.

Expressive Fonts:
- Begin deprecating "Expressive Fonts" toggle.
- Since the app uses a lot of bespoke layouts system fonts very often break them.
- Starting version 2.10 the toggle only applies to the blocky overview font and will be entirely removed once that font is gone.

Enhancements:
- New app icon.

Bug fixes:
- Fix date selector janky transition.
- Fix date selector allowing to select start dates in the future.
- Fix plan reset string not showing when using some system fonts.
- Fix plan reset string not showing when the plan updates daily.
- Fix overview stats overflowing when using some system fonts.

Translations:
